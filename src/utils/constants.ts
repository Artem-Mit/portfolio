  subTitle: "–ê little bit about me:",
  text: `I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed developer who specializes in frontend development (React.js & Next.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.\n\n
  I began my journey as a web developer in 2020, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties, two years after starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss and much more.\n\n
  I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.\n\n
