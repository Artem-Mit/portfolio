    text: "I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed developer who specializes in frontend development (React.js & Next.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.\n\nI began my journey as a web developer in 2020, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties, two years after starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss and much more.\n\nI am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.\n\nYou can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Artem-Mit).",
